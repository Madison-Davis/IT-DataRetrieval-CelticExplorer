Over 500 Logins of Coastal Carbon Data under the project name Celtic Explorer.  R/V Celtic Explorer 2021, Visiting Ports in Cork, Galway, Ireland; Hamburg, Bremerhaven Germany from 2021-02-18 to 2021-08-29	10/year

Coastal regions are very important for understanding the carbon cycle. At these margins many processes are involved: runoff, upwelling and mixing of deep waters, photosynthesis, sinking organic particles, respiration, production and consumption of dissolved organic carbon. This complexity and the highly localized spatial variability of coastal regions has contibuted to a lack of data on carbon stored in coastal regions. CDIAC provides data management support for the Global Coastal Carbon Data Project which includes bottle (discrete) and surface (underway) carbon-related measurements from coastal research cruises, time series cruises, and coastal moorings.  CDIAC's holdings include data for the Western North Atlantic including adjacent seas and Eastern North Atlantic including adjacent seas and Eastern North Pacific.
